# Neovim
Current Neovim version on my system is 8.3. I decided to create my configuration
using the [Lua](https://lua.org) programming language since it is a more modern alternative to
VimScript. Packer is the plugin manager I am currently using. 

## Plugins

### Packer
[packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) is a use-package inspired plugin manager for Neovim. Uses native packages, 
supports luarocks dependencies, written in Lua, allows for expressive config. 

### Telescope
[telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) is a highly extendable fuzzy finder over lists. Built on 
the latest awesome features from `neovim` core. Telescope is centered around
modularity, allowing for easy customization.
