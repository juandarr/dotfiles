# DOTFILES

A compilation of dotfiles for the most important software I use in my Linux distro of choice.

## ZSh

## NVim
My currrent configuration uses Neovim 8.3, Packer as the plugin manager and 
Mason to manage LSP server/utility installation, such as linters, formatters 
and debuggers.
For more information go to [NVim readme page](.config/nvim/README.md).
